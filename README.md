# Product Manager Nano Degree 

My interest in product management started when I developed my first product for my graduation project of my master’s degree. During that time, I worked in a self-managed Agile team for three months to build a website that aims to solve the food waste problem in Australia. In March 2021, I received the Product Manager Nano Degree offered by Udacity. I’m excited to share the projects I completed in this course. 



## In this course I learned: 
-  Pitch a product vision. 
-  Run a design sprint.
