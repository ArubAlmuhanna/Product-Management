# Product Management Nano Degree 

My interest in product management started when I was working on my graduation project during my master’s degree. During that time, I worked in a self-managed Agile team for three months to build a website. Now I'm currently enrolled in the Product Management Nano Degree program offered by Udacity. I’m excited about this course and the opportunity to work on real-world problems.



## In this course I learned: 
-  Pitch a product vision. 
-  Run a design sprint.
